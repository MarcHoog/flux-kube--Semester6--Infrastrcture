# flux-kube
This was my personal repository for working with [FLUX](https://fluxcd.io/) For my Semester 6 infrastructure at Fontys university of Applied sciences
It's not much but it was just to see how flux worked and interacted with Kubernetes

While I did really like the ability to push configuration directly to git and having Flux handle the rest of them, I don't really like the order flux uses to 
publish these configuration. I don't see this being a problem while deploying applications. But it is A little annoying while configuring the base of the kubernetes Cluster. 

# Future of this repository

Since this Repositoy was only really intended for this semester I will be archiving it if I ever need again. I will make a new repository using the things I have learned.
